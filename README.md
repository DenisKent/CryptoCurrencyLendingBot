# Crypto Currency Lending Bot

### User Story
It is possible to lend cryptocurrency to online safely with minimal risk of default using crypto currency exchanges such as [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). Interest rates for lending Bitcoin are very high (>15% interest annually). However, borrowers typically hold your borrowed currencies for only days or hours at a time. The user (Denis) wants a bot to automatically lend his bitcoin at the optimal prices.

### Features:
* Storage of market interest rate for cryptocurrencies
* Analytics of historic interest rates and currently active cryptocurrency lending offers to decide when to offer currency and at what price
* Execution of loan offers
* The bot can work with a range of cryptocurrencies on the Poloniex platform, however it has been set up to work with bitcoin only.


### Note this was one of my first coding projects. Written before I had learnt how to use Git. This is why the Git Flow is only included in the refactoring of the project
